# iCARE

## Background
This is the first project I attempted once I had a basic grasp of the Swift language and learned SwiftUI. The app is aimed at connecting caregivers with clients, and users can create profiles and add tags to help connect them with others who would fit their needs. Users can browse profiles, chat, schedule events, and set reminders. This app was created as a solution to a challenge focused around accessibility with the goal of making someone's life easier.

## How to use it
Currently the app has no functionality, but users can tap different tab icons to navigate between views.
